This project is a CUDA-accelerated path tracer. Many cool features, such as:

Some sample scenes are found in `scenes/`.

## Running the code

You can build the project with `make` and run with `build/cis565_path_tracer
SCENE_FILE.txt`. Some sample scene files are found in `scenes/`.

### Controls

* Esc to save an image and exit.
* Space to save an image. Watch the console for the output filename.
* W/A/S/D and R/F move the camera. Arrow keys rotate.

### Depth of Field

### Antialiasing
### Materials

Diffuse, specular (perfectly and imperfectly reflective), refractive materials.

### Stream compaction.

Shared-memory work-efficient stream compaction.



* Texture mapping
* Bump mapping
* Direct lighting (by taking a final ray directly to a random point on an
  emissive object acting as a light source)
* Some method of defining object motion, and motion blur
* Subsurface scattering
* Arbitrary mesh loading and rendering (e.g. `obj` files). You can find these
  online or export them from your favorite 3D modeling application.
  With approval, you may use a third-party OBJ loading code to bring the data
  into C++.
  * You can use the triangle intersection function `glm::intersectRayTriangle`.

This 'extra features' list is not comprehensive. If you have a particular idea
you would like to implement (e.g. acceleration structures, etc.), please
contact us first.

For each extra feature, you must provide the following analysis:

* Overview write-up of the feature
* Performance impact of the feature
* If you did something to accelerate the feature, what did you do and why?
* Compare your GPU version of the feature to a HYPOTHETICAL CPU version
  (you don't have to implement it!) Does it benefit or suffer from being
  implemented on the GPU?
* How might this feature be optimized beyond your current implementation?

### Scene File Format

This project uses a custom scene description format. Scene files are flat text
files that describe all geometry, materials, lights, cameras, and render
settings inside of the scene. Items in the format are delimited by new lines,
and comments can be added using C-style `// comments`.

Materials are defined in the following fashion:

* MATERIAL (material ID) //material header
* RGB (float r) (float g) (float b) //diffuse color
* SPECX (float specx) //specular exponent
* SPECRGB (float r) (float g) (float b) //specular color
* REFL (bool refl) //reflectivity flag, 0 for no, 1 for yes
* REFR (bool refr) //refractivity flag, 0 for no, 1 for yes
* REFRIOR (float ior) //index of refraction for Fresnel effects
* EMITTANCE (float emittance) //the emittance of the material. Anything >0
  makes the material a light source.

Cameras are defined in the following fashion:

* CAMERA //camera header
* RES (float x) (float y) //resolution
* FOVY (float fovy) //vertical field of view half-angle. the horizonal angle is calculated from this and the reslution
* ITERATIONS (float interations) //how many iterations to refine the image,
  only relevant for supersampled antialiasing, depth of field, area lights, and
  other distributed raytracing applications
* DEPTH (int depth) //maximum depth (number of times the path will bounce)
* FILE (string filename) //file to output render to upon completion
* EYE (float x) (float y) (float z) //camera's position in worldspace
* VIEW (float x) (float y) (float z) //camera's view direction
* UP (float x) (float y) (float z) //camera's up vector

Objects are defined in the following fashion:

* OBJECT (object ID) //object header
* (cube OR sphere OR mesh) //type of object, can be either "cube", "sphere", or
  "mesh". Note that cubes and spheres are unit sized and centered at the
  origin.
* material (material ID) //material to assign this object
* TRANS (float transx) (float transy) (float transz) //translation
* ROTAT (float rotationx) (float rotationy) (float rotationz) //rotation
* SCALE (float scalex) (float scaley) (float scalez) //scale

Two examples are provided in the `scenes/` directory: a single emissive sphere,
and a simple cornell box made using cubes for walls and lights and a sphere in
the middle.

## README

Please see: [**TIPS FOR WRITING AN AWESOME README**](https://github.com/pjcozzi/Articles/blob/master/CIS565/GitHubRepo/README.md)

* Sell your project.
* Assume the reader has a little knowledge of path tracing - don't go into
  detail explaining what it is. Focus on your project.
* Don't talk about it like it's an assignment - don't say what is and isn't
  "extra" or "extra credit." Talk about what you accomplished.
* Use this to document what you've done.
* *DO NOT* leave the README to the last minute! It is a crucial part of the
  project, and we will not be able to grade you without a good README.

In addition:

* This is a renderer, so include images that you've made!
* Be sure to back your claims for optimization with numbers and comparisons.
* If you reference any other material, please provide a link to it.
* You wil not be graded on how fast your path tracer runs, but getting close to
  real-time is always nice!
* If you have a fast GPU renderer, it is very good to show case this with a
  video to show interactivity. If you do so, please include a link!

### Analysis

* Stream compaction helps most after a few bounces. Print and plot the
  effects of stream compaction within a single iteration (i.e. the number of
  unterminated rays after each bounce) and evaluate the benefits you get from
  stream compaction.
* Compare scenes which are open (like the given cornell box) and closed
  (i.e. no light can escape the scene). Again, compare the performance effects
  of stream compaction! Remember, stream compaction only affects rays which
  terminate, so what might you expect?
